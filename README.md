# Rakugo
## Most applications of blockchain technology rely on the ability to tokenize all the things. ![alt text](https://memegenerator.net/instance/64103710) For the Ethereum blockchain, the cost of deploying a smart contract is a high barrier for entry and pretty much a deal breaker for projects intent on exchanging value using erc20 tokens. However, the cost of method execution is cheaper by an order of magnitude or more. What if we could fix the cost barrier of tokenized economies by reusing the logic in smart contracts already deployed? In accordance with the laws of entropy a protocol that reduces gas prices while preserving functionality would create an economic zone on the Ethereum blockchain, which if backed by a liquidity agent (utility token), the liquidity agent would have inherently more value than ether itself.

# Entropy and the value of Rakugo
## Following principals of Thermoeconomics if we consider an economy as a dissipative system, the optimization of said economy is the reduction of entropy. An erc20 token that transfers value with a reduction of energy loss (gas price) would have relatively less entropy than ether. This is the intrinsic value of Rakugo and it is amplified via a staking economy that rewards long time users/investors while providing functionality of method execution at the same rate as ether. Stakes in Rakugo grow as the market cap grows, but the cost of interacting with Rakugo stays the same. Our ICO serves a similar purpose to other protocol ICO's like Ethereum in the sense that we are seeding the network.

# Rakugo Protocol
## API for smart contracts used in Rakugo. The protocol implements an interface for chaining together the logic of smart contracts, like a parent type such that a collection of Rakugo objects is covariant and their aggregate functionality is the result of a reduce operator. Engineers can choose if or how to share value created by users who choose their contract. This is similar to a dev bounty program, where if your smart contract is dank then it will probably generate a lot of value for the creator. Dank Rakugo yo.

# Constellation
## A library for interacting with smart contracts that implement the Rakugo protocol. The goal is to provide utilities for interacting with these smart contracts using mapreduce like operators. Conceptually, we can think of Dapps utilizing rakugo as a reduce operation on a collection of smart contract objects (where each object extends a parent type thus they are all covariant). Instead of deploying often duplicate smart contracts, we just reuse what's already on the blockchain. This allows users to "make their own sandwich" with good community pruned code.

# Rakugo Token
## Liquidity agent of Rakugo. This token will eventually become a Bancor Smart Token. 

# Meme token
## I like calling it this better than user token, because Rakugo is essentially the first true meme economy. Users interact with goods and services via their own tokenized representation and reputation determines your success in the network. A meme token is essentially a factory class for issuing mapreduce operations on Rakugo protocol contracts. The goal is to only deploy one per user (obviously as many as one or an organization chooses perhaps for development of management purposes) and then the user can orchestrate blockchain logic using factory methods on their memetic representation in the network. 

# Noospheric energy generation
## Rakugo Token's staked economy coupled with the rakugo protocol is essentially an economic generator (like a solar panel), transmuting ideas in the noosphere into commercial energy.
